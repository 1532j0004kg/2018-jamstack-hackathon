## Boilerplates
Boilerplates are great to get started, and to learn how someone uses certain tech and architects in a specific way. However, since you didn't make these choices on your own, you lose the education of _why_ someone chose to build their app in this manner, and it may actually slow you down or frustrate you in the long run.  
**TLDR:** Boilerplates are great for hackathons, not so much for production. Use with caution.

### [Create-React-App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
This is the official boilerplate created by members of the React Core Team at Facebook  with the help of open-source contributors. It is the easiest of all boilerplates, as it hides most of the configuration files to narrow your focus. You can get started in the CLI with:  
```
npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app my-app
cd my-app/
npm start
```
Create-React-App helps you to create a React project without worrying too much about configuration. To customize your boilerplate, you can "eject". Learn more about this and other features of create-react-app here https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app  

### [Create-React-Native-App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app)
```
$ npm install -g create-react-native-app
$ create-react-native-app my-app
$ cd my-app/
$ npm start
```
