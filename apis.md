# Netlify
#### Quick Description
Netlify provides [Continuous Delivery](https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment), 1-click HTTPS, [Custom Domains](https://www.netlify.com/docs/custom-domains/), integrated prerendering, and a custom global CDN.

### Purpose
[Progressive Web Apps](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) are user experiences that are fast, secure, and engaging. Netlify helps you get there with our asset optimization and free SSL integration.

Netlify improves your workflow with Deploy Previews that work by deploying every pull request from your git repository to a unique URL; completely different from the one your main site uses. You and your team can see how those changes look before theyâ€™re merged into the main branch and deployed to production.

To help you discover Deploy Previews, we put those links where it helps your team the most, directly in the pull request as commit statuses:

We keep this preview up to date as you continue to work, committing new changes to the same branch. Our CDN takes care of invalidating the cache every time for you.
