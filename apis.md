## Netlify
Netlify automates deployment for your frontend, serving your apps and sites over our custom global Content Delivery Network. You won't need server-side rendering with our integrated [prerendering](https://www.netlify.com/docs/prerendering), [proxy redirects](https://www.netlify.com/docs/redirects), [form handling](https://www.netlify.com/docs/form-handling), [user authentication](https://www.netlify.com/docs/identity), [serverless Lambda functions](https://www.netlify.com/docs/functions), and more.

### Purpose
Developers everywhere are using the [JAMstack](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-concept-behind-JAMstack) approach to connect blazing fast frontends to a growing array of microservice APIs. There are lots of advantages to this, but sometimes you need to run a bit of server-side code. It's not worth running a whole server for, and that approach doesn't scale well, anyway. Serverless functions services like AWS Lambda are perfect for this, and Netlify's [new functions add-on](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2018/03/20/netlifys-aws-lambda-functions-bring-the-backend-to-your-frontend-workflow/) makes it easy to deploy, test, and access your Lambda functions right alongside the rest of your app.

### Challenge
We are looking for the most interesting app using Netlify's integrated Lambda [functions](https://www.netlify.com/docs/functions).

To be eligible for the prize, your app must be deployed to Netlify, and use at least one Lambda function.

# TokBox
#### Quick Description

Easy to use API for embedding WebRTC-based interactive live video into your web and mobile apps. 

### Purpose

Allow your app users to communicate and be seen with Live Video.

The TokBox API builds on WebRTC and is available for JavaScript (browsers), iOS, Android and Windows. We have ReactJS and ReactNative sample code showing how to use the APIs within React. Modern browsers, including Chrome, Firefox and Safari, have WebRTC built-in and so JS apps can be easily run with no plugins. Mobile deploymemts simply include our SDKs.

In addition to live video and voice, the API also provides screensharing, session recording, inter-client signaling, chat/messaging and other capabilities.

The TokBox cloud platform (PaaS) scales from one-to-one video interactions to large multi-party video chat sessions to interactive broadcasts to huge audiences, including concurrent streaming to Facebook, YouTube and Twitch. TokBox is trusted by thousands of global customers including leading social media apps and industry apps in Healthcare, eLearning, Financial Services and Entertainment.

### Challenges

Live Video augments the user experience of your app, so dev challenge is to think through your UX and when and how video communications enhances workflows and processes your users need to perform within your overall app design.

Social use-cases tend to emphasize users meeting ad-hoc and communicating between themselves while industry use-cases tend to emphasize well-defined moments such as doctor/patient consultations and eLearning classrooms with teachers and many students.

### Prizes

$250 Prize for the team showing the best use of Live Video in a Web or Mobile App using our OpenTok APIs, including OpenTok ReactJS or OpenTok ReactNative. Prize provided in multiple Visa and Amazon gift cards that can be distributed between team members.
