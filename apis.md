# Netlify
#### Quick Description
Netlify provides [Continuous Delivery](https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment), 1-click HTTPS, [Custom Domains](https://www.netlify.com/docs/custom-domains/), integrated prerendering, and a custom global CDN.

### Purpose
[Progressive Web Apps](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) are user experiences that are fast, secure, and engaging. Netlify helps you get there with our asset optimization and free SSL integration.

Netlify improves your workflow with Deploy Previews that work by deploying every pull request from your git repository to a unique URL; completely different from the one your main site uses. You and your team can see how those changes look before theyâ€™re merged into the main branch and deployed to production.

To help you discover Deploy Previews, we put those links where it helps your team the most, directly in the pull request as commit statuses:

We keep this preview up to date as you continue to work, committing new changes to the same branch. Our CDN takes care of invalidating the cache every time for you.

# TokBox
#### Quick Description

Easy to use API for embedding WebRTC-based interactive live video into your web and mobile apps. 

### Purpose

Allow your app users to communicate and be seen with Live Video.

The TokBox API builds on WebRTC and is available for JavaScript (browsers), iOS, Android and Windows. We have ReactJS and ReactNative sample code showing how to use the APIs within React. Modern browsers, including Chrome, Firefox and Safari, have WebRTC built-in and so JS apps can be easily run with no plugins. Mobile deploymemts simply include our SDKs.

In addition to live video and voice, the API also provides screensharing, session recording, inter-client signaling, chat/messaging and other capabilities.

The TokBox cloud platform (PaaS) scales from one-to-one video interactions to large multi-party video chat sessions to interactive broadcasts to huge audiences, including concurrent streaming to Facebook, YouTube and Twitch. TokBox is trusted by thousands of global customers including leading social media apps and industry apps in Healthcare, eLearning, Financial Services and Entertainment.

### Challenges

Live Video augments the user experience of your app, so dev challenge is to think through your UX and when and how video communications enhances workflows and processes your users need to perform within your overall app design.

Social use-cases tend to emphasize users meeting ad-hoc and communicating between themselves while industry use-cases tend to emphasize well-defined moments such as doctor/patient consultations and eLearning classrooms with teachers and many students.
